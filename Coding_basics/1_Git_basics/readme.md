# Lesson 1

This lesson describes the absolute basics necessary for a computing project. 


### Installing Python
Make sure you have reasonably updated versions of numpy, matplotlib, and scipy. 
Make sure you can run Python from the terminal. 
On Mac or Linux: Conda is a good package manager to do all of this.
On a PC: I'm not quite sure. 


### Python2 vs Python3 
We will mostly use Python3 for this project to be safe. 
The main differences involve print statements, np.round(), integer division. 
Why we are doing this: 
-Python3 is the way of the future. 
-Most Python3 code will run in Python2 if necessary.

### Installing Git
We'll figure out how to do it on each machine. This is IMPORTANT. 


### Get a github account
https://github.com/
Become friends with me!  


### Git repositories
Make your own sample repository!
git init
Write some code to say Hello World, take an array [0:2*np.pi], and print the sines and cosines
Make a simple plot. 
Git add, status, commit
gitignore

### Github Basics
SSH Keys
git clone
Github push, pull


### Project 0: 
We will all become collaborators on the same "research basics" github repo
