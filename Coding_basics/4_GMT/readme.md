# Lesson 4

This lesson describes the necessary skills in GMT. The truth about GMT is we all learn by doing.  This tutorial will not be very helpful by itself; it will just give you the "goal posts".  Google and GMT's documentation are your friend here.  The first time, this may take you close to a day.  Good luck! 

## Core GMT Skills
* pscoast, psvelo, psxy, grdimage
* makecpt, psscale
* project (Saeed)
* Tricky mistakes: -K vs -O, >> vs > 
* Defining variables in your scripts
* Grid files: grdinfo, grdsample, grdmath

## First: 
* Install GMT.  Either use Macports, Homebrew, or whatever happens on PC.  This may take a while... 


## Project 3: 
* Make a map of GPS velocities in Northern California. Plot faults, and add earthquakes. Include km scale bar and velocity scale. Bonus: Add topography and provide a topography color scale.  
* When you're done, put a .png of the map into the Github repo's readme to make it look beautiful! 


## Project 3: 
* If that's too easy, make a depth profile of the earthquakes across the San Andreas Fault system in Northern California.
