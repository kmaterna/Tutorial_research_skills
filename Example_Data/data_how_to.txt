# How to get data

GPS DATA: 
GPS Data is downloaded from the UNAVCO Plate Boundary Observatory
Data exploration: https://www.unavco.org/instrumentation/networks/status/pbo/gps
FTP site: 
ftp://data-out.unavco.org/pub/products
Data download is through using wget from their ftp site (or just copying the text). 
This example time series: 
ftp://data-out.unavco.org/pub/products/position/P158/P158.cwu.nam08.pos
Example downloaded on May 9, 2019. 

GPS VELOCITIES:
PBO ftp site (try to find it). 


EARTHQUAKE CATALOGS:
The best earthquake catalogs in Northern California come from ncedc.org
http://ncedc.org/ncedc/catalog-search.html
You can search for geographic boxes, etc. 
Always save your search parameters with your dataset. 



TOPOGRAPHY:
The best medium-resolution global topography is from ETOPO1. 
Good idea to download this once, and then refer to it forever. 
I downloaded a file that was about 900Mb. 
Misc/Mapping_Resources/Global_topography_data/ETOPO1_Bed_g_gmt4.grd
And then I refer to it and subsample it for most of my larger-scale mapping needs. 
The best high-resolution global topography is from SRTM. 
You can download individual tiles and use them for specific regions. 



FAULT LINES: 
There is a USGS catalog of fault lines (holocene, quaternary, etc). 
I will provide this in GMT and Matlab formats. 
Every grad student passes this to the next grad student through a flash drive. 
But I imagine you could find them from USGS as well.
