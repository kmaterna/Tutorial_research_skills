Skills covered: 

Topic 1: Getting Python
Python installation, miniconda
conda environments, site-packages, numpy/matplotlib/scipy, python2 vs python3
Import statements, path, pythonpath
writing your configuration down
IDEs

Topic 2: Software Design Principles
Functions vs. Files vs. Libraries
Separation of data and code
Configure, input, compute, output, driver
Lists, arrays, dictionaries, tuples
	https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/python/data_structures.html
Named tuples

Topic 3: Useful Python Libraries
Datetime
Np.loadtxt
Matrix math, np.shape, np.size
subplots, plot_date, histograms, twinx
Project 1 as exercises.

Topic 4: Git and Github
Github, get accounts, gitignore, commit, push, pull, PAT, fork, pull request
We will all become collaborators on the same "research basics" github repo
Project 2: Earthquake catalogs. Combine forces to construct functions that read, write, plot, histogram, map, filter, and reduce. 

Extended topic: GMT

Big Project: Linear least squares
Read Menke Ch. 1-3
Use linear least squares to solve for the best-fitting slopes, seasonal terms, etc. from GPS time series
Remove the earthquakes. 
Plot the results on top of the GPS time series. 
Remove the functional fit and plot the residuals. 

Tips: 
Always write down where, when, and how you got your data!
